This is a scratch pad to work on the s3 structure so that we can use it to
find our results without having to look things up in the databases:


/s3bucket/$project_id/$build_id/logs/combined.log
/s3bucket/$project_id/$build_id/logs/*
/s3bucket/$project_id/$build_id/artifacts/build-final.tar.gz
/s3bucket/$project_id/$build_id/artifacts/*
/s3bucket/$project_id/$build_id/reports/*

Includes $project_id so we can clean up entire projects at a time without
having to do a DB trawl
